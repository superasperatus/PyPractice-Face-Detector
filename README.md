# PyPractice-Face-Detector

This is my initial walks into programming and developing.

This readme file line is being written to test out how atom changes can be pushed to git, and then later reviewed locally.

This line is created to test out the branching and merging. From atom-edits-2 to master. And again to local of course.  

Application created as a part of a course.
